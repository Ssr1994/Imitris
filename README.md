This is an old project, a clone of Tetris.

There are 3 kinds special pieces:
1. Vapor: looks like "##", which clears all the columns underneath it.
2. Foam: looks like "#", which fills a space of 3 by 3 as long as the slot may be reached from where the foam piece is resided.
3. Crazy: whose shape looks indeed crazy. It reverses the left and right directions.

If you are not clear what I am talking about, download it, compile it, and have a try.
